two of that I went to Atlanta but I bought my ticket myself and it was clearly on Vacation
time for me, um, and I took my own bag. I don't know if that's (inaudible) (sighs).

(Laughsthere?

He went for a work trip. He was invited to as a- one of the representatives, it was some
kind of sharing of learning between Portland and Atlanta, I think 

Was it a group thing or just him?
It was a group thing.
How many- do you know how many people?

I- I don't know but I got the sense it was pretty good number. More than 20 I thought
anyway.

Was it a conf- I mean a conference at a particular place? Or was it 

no, I think it was literally one of those like learn- like city to city learning of like
what they're doing around sustainability and what they- we could take from that for
learning so kind of touring and seeing what they were doing.

So you booked your own stuff?

Yeah.

On your (unintelligible) this is Vacation for you?

I bought- bought it on Expedia, my own credit card, like I said, a couple weeks before I
had- I had been hemming and hawing about going and only because I could get under a
certain 



but I took the whole Vacation, I ho- I took the whole week off. Portland Public had

a school closure that week as well so I was- I just wanted the whole week off to be with
my kids as well and um, but I did go, I did go.

Bar- like his assistant, Barb or something? I'm not totally sure.

Why? 

Because we were going to stay there. He-- so he changed the hotel so that we- you know
that we were in a different place, 1 mean that's the truth of it, um, I also asked him to if
there was any difference that you know he's got to cover that or I'd be willing to cover
that um and he said that he had it taken care of. I didn't. ..

How?

didn't ask him again. Sorry?

How did he have it taken care of? You don't know specifically?

I don't know, I mean 1- again you know, 1- I guess I should have made sure specifically

but 1- I do know' that I asked him about it, 1 said you know this is really clearly on my 
personal time, 1'm.taking vacation, clear lines here for me and you know that- I don't

know what the difference is but if there is any that we- you know we should pay for that. A

When did you have thatconversation?

Oh, before 

Relative to the um you going to Atlanta I guess.

Um when he was booking it I suppose because 1- yeah 1 mean 1- 1- bef- as he was
booking it maybe when we were walking or probably when we were walking um, 1- I
know I at least said it once if not a couple times 'cause I'm kind of obsessive like that,

um but 

You- you made it sound like the conversation was if there is a difference; did you know

that there was a difference?

1don't know I "mean 1. ..
It was more- it was more if there is we should, I mean or did he tell you at some point?
Um, I mean I'm- I'm not sure I mean 1- I don't if I got- it was kind of in his- it was kind

of the thing I've- 1- you know I'll- I'll go, this is- this is you know your- your figuring
that piece that out and 1 just want to be clear that if there's any difference 1'm- I'm okay

. to- like I'm- I'll pay for that, like 1 don't care, like it's no big deal to me at that point to- 1

want to make sure it's clean, I'm making the effort to make sure that I'm taking the
whole week off to make sure it's really separate, so I mean honestly, I thought it was- it
sounds stupid now, I thought it was a bit of no-brainer to cover that I mean because we
are so- just being there for so long that 1- I'd- 1'd- why would we do th- like why do that-

that doesn't make sense to me and so I said it offering or suggesting he take care of it and
I just thought he would.

So if he didn't and I don't know because we haven't looked at it- if he did not cover that
do you think that was appropriate or inappropriate? 

I mean he should have covered it, I mean I do think 
And I don't know if that's a question that- question you should be asking.

Well no I mean she- she knows-- she knows the work policies. I mean if you were in his
position you would, it sounds like, based on your 

Of course I would have.
would have paid for it.
Yeah, of course I would have. Again I realize within the whole thing that I- you know,

that made my own miss-steps and so its like I'm trying to figure out how to say this
but like it's- that's the truth for me within this weirdness I was trying to stay above board.

So when- when you flew in, how did you get from the hotel or from the airport
to the hotel?

I-- I took a cab myself.

A cab?

Yeah.

Okay.

So he was already there?

Yeah.

Was he already there? Okay.

Yeah, yeah. Yeah, I mean I was pretty- I-- I was- I was trying to do it for what really
worked um for my tick- like I booked my own thing independently.

MANHAS: So, I got in in the evening and I didn't want to take public transit, but I paid for that cab
myself, so, 

WELLS: Okay, then how'd you get from the hotel back to the airport?

MANHAS: I took public transit, it was in the day- it was in the morning.

WELLS: Okay. . 

MANHAS: Or the afternoon, so.

the same flight, it was not anything that I had asked for or anything but um I was getting

ready to go and- and uh he let me know that he was coming-- he was gonna come back
too, so I go okay (laughs). A

WELLS: A So he took public transportation with you back to the airport?

MANHAS: Uh huh.
WELLS: A Okay and 

KMETIC: Does that mean the conference was cut short for him or whatever he was attending? I
mean it- I mean you said that he wasn't supposed to be coming back, was it 

MANHAS: He decided to come back sooner.
KMETIC: Okay, was the conference still going?

MANHAS: Yeah.
KMETIC: Okay, how much longer was the conference supposed to go? -

MANHAS: Um, I'm not- I'm not- I'm not sure to be honest. I don't- I don't know if he- if- I can't
remember if he was supposed to spend another night or if he was supposed to head back
that evening, been trying to think about it and I can't remember what the schedule
was. 

KMETIC:   Okay.

It was to spend (unintelligible)

and I had to- you know I- I did the cheapest route I could. (Laughs) Um so, but yeah we

did take transit back to the airport together and 

What about um food and all that type of stuff while you were there? I mean how's that I
paid for?

Yeah, I mean same- same thing that we you know 1- I'd pay for mine, we'd split or
whatever. It was not my understanding that anything was on county funds because it- not-

that.

happy to speak to this.

(Unintelligible -- laughing) Okayread The Willamette Week.

So you know what the quest- I mean- we just wanna- what- you know what the questions
are about this.

So obviously the accusation there is that you made an-- an end-around and you got this
budget passed. . 

no.

So let's- let's talk about that.

No, l- I re- the magic power people think I have is unbelievable. No not at all, not at all.
The budget process is led by Lillian SHIRLEY and Wendy Lear, that she's the Budget

Manager and you know the- the- the- the truth is- tu- there's a long term truth of the fact
that we- I mean 1- I- can't say we haven't been trying to build a case for Prevention and

A the work for many years, right? Of course, we've been trying to build, but this is like

good work and it is good work and um the grant has been ramping down, right? And so
we-- obviously we were like okay how were we going to sustain capacity? But it- I'd
had nothing to do with the budget planning. Lillian told me in one of the supervision
meetings that I had with her, like one of our check-ins that the county was going be- put
forward two out- out of budget constraint proposals and one would be related to the
Office of-- of Policy and Planning. I was thrilled um but no I mean not the- the- the- the
stuff about the finances 1- I- again, I know there's a scale but there's just no way that I
would- I would do that kind of an-- an ask and I really respect Lillian. She's had- she's
been a mentor for-- for me for years and that's been what- part of the painful thing here. I
am not trying to undermi- what- what would I gain by undermining Lillian? Nothing, that

doesn't make sense. So they directed me to put together what would the budget- what
would that look like? And it was an increase of an 1.0 and why it wasn't in that February

not- I don't know how they put that stuff together, I didn't seerthe document even to be
honest with you in what was submitted. I'm just- I'm just doin' what Wendy's telling me
to do to put together the proposals. The challenges the Health Department has a perspereputation of- of- of being murky in how this information's shared
and I feel like I've been caught up in that a little~bit of- of- it's not very clear and how are
the numbers moving. And I just don?t actually know the answer to that. I was just trying
to put forth what- when- when they- what they wanted when they wanted it but.I had
nothing to do with that, I never- never ever asked Jeff for any kind of special you know
throw--in around money or work at all, um. 

WELLS: Do you remember ever talking to Jeff about that budget proposal?

MANHAS: That specific budget proposal? No, I mean budget generally, yes and budget generally
yes in saying to him that I- you know we- there's a lot of complicated things he's
balancing and I get that. I mean more than anything I'm compensating to say remember,
this is work, work. Keep that all really clear. And I really want the work to speak for
itself. I- I mean I built it 

WELLS Okay.

MANHAS: me and appointing a health educator to building a capacity for an area of work in
the department that -never existed and I- I- I really believe that I did not ask um even
Lillian wanted them to recognize it and see that this was the right- you know that this was
the right time for them to make the ask.

KMETIC: I really want you to think and I'm not saying you haven't, but I really want you to think
about this 

MANHAS: Okay.
KMETIC: this looks, I mean honestly it looks bad.
MANHAS: Yeah, yeah- yeah.

KMETIC: It looks ba- and it looks bad because we got the Chair, the Chair does his executive
- 

MANHAS: (whispers) I know.

had with him, rm not saying you're doing anything wrong.

KMETIC: But how those conversations could have 

MANHAS: 

KMETIC: is this coming from Lillian?

MANHAS: This is- I mean I honestly- there's a few parts of this story that we haven't gone into that
are- that are reflecting on me but are part of the murky- murky bureaucracy and I wish
that I could have even- look I'm not even in those budget meetings. I was thrilled when
she said we're only putting two forward. I can't remember what the other one was but

one will be for this office. And I was like that's fantast- that's fantastic 

KMETIC: But I have to assume, I mean not to interrupt, but I have to assume at that point, you've
got this relationship with 

MANHAS: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
KMETIC: after you hear 

MANHAS: Yeah.

KMETIC: mean, any normal person would go back to Jeff and say, oh my gosh, I hear that-
even if you didn't know about it 

MANHAS: Right, right, right.

KMETIC: hear that we're going to get blah,' blah, blah, do you realize how-- I mean are there

conversations like that? Do you know what that would do for-- do you really understand
what that would do for us? You know what I mean?

I think you can explain about-- I mean the- the grant had 

KMETIC: No, I know about the grant part, but I'm talking how 

know ran out and it needed funding and 

MANHAS: I mean, god, I mean I- I don't know it's sort of the- the- it's like the question around the
intent part here, you know like, this idea that I was trying to exercise undue influence is

just not the case but- 

not suggesting that you are but I'm wondering whether Jeff' actions or budget
were impacted by your personal relationship? So this is not a comment about you.

Yeah, no I-- I hear you, I mean I. ..

And let's face it, he obviously cared or cares, I don't know a lot about you so it would not
surprise me in the least if he clearly knows how important the work is, you know, despite
the fact that the work is good, I mean that's separate, I mean, he wan-

I- yeah I mean I'm thinking- I've been thinking about this a lot, I mean in the sense of
what- what did we- what did we- what did we meanand then what- how did it actually
color people's decision making and you know the truth is, I didn't have the power
around- like somebody else made a decision and not me, I don't know, I don't know how
it influences decising-, decisions but what- what I can say is that we were ramping down,
you know, 7.5 million dollar grant, that meant a lot of positions lost and it was meager
and you look at the general fund across the whole department it was so meager for
sustaining any capacity that fo- that I- that I do stand on my feet to say that for the work
that was done it was tiny. I mean I know the headline says double, it's 1.0, I mean from a
team of 60, like it was- it was meager and I think that it- there was sufficient work done
to say that's pretty reasonable 

But can I ask 
but I'm- but I'm- but but I'm acknowledging what you're saying.

Can I ask it a different way? If you didn't have the relationship that you had with Jeff do
you think his budget recommendation would have been same? 

I actually do, I do. I think that the work is-is- is the new Public Health with the- the
whole- the- the transistion with healthcare transformation, that we've- we've just have
had no- we'd been so direct service, we had no capacity for this broader work that yeah, I
think so. Maybe if it wasn't me, maybe it would have been more (laughs), I don't know.
(Women laugh) Because somebody else might have made a better case. I don't know,


Okay, it was pretty meager.

So just to-- to clarif- to clarify it, was it 1.0 or 1.5 because the commissioner's that we'Ve
spoke to, they believed it was 1.5 FTE.

Um and this is again where I would go back to Wendy LEER and Lillian because if you
back to the budget hearing where I was speaking to the budget and they all pretty much- I
was like a deer in the headlines in trying to explain it all because they- they- they- they
pret- they put it 

Okay.

so I- 1- I can still barely explain it.

So why do they you do the bud- budget presentation?
Um, well multiple of us 

Okay.

I speak to the work. I was at the end. It was very Volatile- it was a very combative
budget hearing to begin with and I was the end and it wasn't very fun.

It sounds like you were getting questioned a lot.

Yeah and they quest- questioning the work quite a bit and then I- I did wrap around and
talk- so this is that direct communication thing, I went back and I talked to those
commissioners 1- you know we shared information to clarify what it was so they could
understand what the work was, so but it- it was murky to begin with let alone adding this
in.

Did you ever hear from any commissioners that they were frustrated with that-- about your
process and how your budget was handled?

Um sure I mean in the hearing directly I mean that this was a public meeting and that's
why that was a part of the reflection of the direct work that I- that I understand that the
health department has- like the bigger health department has this kind of different
relationship with them, it's the first time I was in this-- this kind of a role, and that's not-
but my personal relationship with each of them has always been real positive and I-
because been trying to work directly with them, and so when I saw it was like uh oh,
now I'm getting put in sort of the health department, you're being murky and ambiguous
and like are you guys moving things around and I'm going I don't really know and can I-
and so I went back to my own personal relationship and said I'm gonna follow up with
you directly, I will lay it all out for as best I know it and you can make- I defer to your
decision making, of course, if this is not what you want to fund in relation to everything
else, I respect that. Of course, I respect that. Um, so I did my best, wro- to reach out
them and- and to communicate with the- budgets were and they seemed assured at that
point if they're not- if they weren't I don't- they assured me they were assured (laughs).

No. Can I as a general question that 1- We're probably gonna get there, uh, yeah, go
ahead. 

And well and I- I want to acknowledge, I- I don't want to say that I have it all figured out
on this, you know this is complicated and- and- if- if it influenced I don't really know
how I mean how it might have. 

Well it's subjective 

Yeah.

have to be in eff' head, but clearly you're in a relationship so I mean I would
assume maybe that there were conversations about it and the importance and um- did you
ever ask him to talk to any other commissioners or? 

No, no, n- about the budget?
Eh, yeah, about the import- I mean you know I don't know.

No, not at all, never, never, and- and- and he's- he's- he's tough, I mean he's tough too,
he's got his priorities and like I've said, they've- they've supplanted mine many times
and it's been in-incredibly frustrating from a public health standpoint and- you know
from the work standpoint and so um I don't think he'd hesitate to say, sorry, you know
that's not what's gonna happen. I mean there- there were things that will come up in the
budget that.aren't in print yet urn that he- that they will- but he- he- put something in and
he put it in your program area, there's a food program offer that's gonna come up, I
didn't even know about that. Supposed to have this- you know if I had this personal 
relationship with him no- nobody told me, I only got directed by my budget office that
the Chair wants to put this in here, it's actually a pass-through to another provid-- you
know a community based organization and I'm like what do you- what- what is that?
That doesn't make any sensethat 'cause I was asked to, but
I can see now someone's gonna print that within the next couple days to say he- he- he
planted this in there and I- I didn't even know what it was.

when you went to Jeff when you should have went to and keep in mind that this is
in my mind is an employment issue not a criminal issue at all but that you went to Jeff for
something or something as it relates to your work without going through your chain of
command?

Um so this- this is- this is obviously been coming up in the- in the- in the stuff too that-
this is- this is challenging because there was an ex- there was an acceptance that I was
working directly with the office, you know, for a lot of the work that got done that was
known and accepted and encouraged.

By Lillian?
By Lillian.
Okay.

By Lorene, by- you know his staff knew that I had that direct relationship even before
anything you know any of this happened as he was a commissioner, so now you're- you
know I'm being asked if there were examples but there was acceptance that that was okay
and so like an example that I'll give around like the policy stuff is this- this- this- this
speculation that I was going around his staff, around um tobacco policy, you know and I
wasn't, they- you know if you pull all the emails between me and Emerald BOGUE
you're gonna fmd- or Emerald WALKER now, you're gonna find a whole bunch of
emails because we worked really, really closely together.

What about the sippy cup thing?

Oh the sippy. cup thing. That was so early at the beginning of this. Yeah, let's- that's a
good example too. That's a really good example. I was working directly with his staff
and I know this really bothered them actually so I really do want to clarify this one, this
was on the BPA 



I was directly with um his staff Guillermo and Emerald. They- Em- you know this
was new work for Guillermo in terms of the- the policy part, I mean I've been at the
county for a lot of years, I've been doing this for a bit of time, I was trying my very best
to coordinate with them and- and to write it the way they wanted it, right'? Um, Guillermo
wrote the scope of the policy, this is so nuance, but he wrote the scope of the policy to
include a broader range of beverage containers then 1- then I- then I knew Jeff intended.
He wanted to match the state law but his staff was going further than expected. So he
miss-wrote it but he-- he asked me to write it, so I ended up miss-writing this because I'm
like okay I got to look- I'm listening to the staff, right? I'm doing this the best I can, I
even got on a phone call. I said you know Marissa, Emerald and Guillermo, let's all get'

on the phone because I really want you to make sure this is the language you need for the
scope. Yeah, they said, yeah that's what they mean, so it got leaked to the press that it-
how it was written and Jeff was mad because it was bigger than he wanted and he called
me directly and said, this is not what I intended and I said, I know but I was trying- I'm

trying to do the work through your staff, like they- that's what they told me to do and so

he said can you care take of it? To- to rewrite it, I said _sure but you know you're gonna
need to make sure that ev-- like they understand that you're asking me to do or otherwise
I'm in a difficult position. It was for the- but it was for the quality of the work that he
knew that I was understanding this spec- specificity of the water bottle- the water bottles
and the baby sippy cups and not this broad ban on containers generally which would have
been really problematic and so Guillermo they were upset with me because they saw me
circumventing and he 

Who was upset with you, the commissioners, or?

No, no, his staff wa-- were.

Oh his staff, okay. 

Yeah and Guillermo ye- I mean he yelled at me and said you know your undermining me
and I'm like I'm just trying to do what this-the Chair is telling me what policy
implication is, are- you know the policy scope is. Um, the commissioners being angry
about that'? Um, that-- that's tricky. Is that what you're asking? A

I- yeah I guess, I mean I don't know that it matters.

They were really-- they were really mad about- they were mad about him doing that but
we-I always got strong direction from my director that we work for the- there's a board,
but we work for the Chair and if the Chair wants to move the policy forward you've got

to staff 'em on' it and so I did that.

So you would agree in terms of access, I mean in terms of you being up on the sixth




you're probably

Absolutely, when you're- whe- when I'm working a policy issue or food which is you

up there meeting those guys a lot but like I said th- the commissioners are gonna have a-
a different perspective because they see- there- there jockeying around the policy work a
lot but I've gotten str- strong direction that in the county structure department's work for
the county Chair and so that's why there is in- he's a CEO of the organization and so
that's why you see so much more traffic there that like if you're gonna have an event,
first talk to Jeff and then- then go to the commissioners. I mean I was told that to make
sure that you know- as long as Marissa and Jeff are good, then your f1- you know I got
that direction but now it looks all disproportionate.

this is inappropriate, I mean any, you know whatever, however they would handle
it, anything that led you

that what you were doing was. ..

No, because I mean 1- I hope you believe me that intent of the work or doing traffic

even public health by training I'm just kind of doing what I can do, urn, it was for getting
good work done for the community and that- that's the part that's been so frustrating in
the conversation is every part of this was to get some good work or ye- you know done to
move the dial on health outcomes and no, I was never told to pull back, we were moving
good work forward or I thought we were and 1- if people had concerns I don't understand
why nobody told me.

And (unintelligible) you- you felt like you were in touch with Lillian and with

all over the calendar with Lillian.

the fact that you have a separation agreement and Mr. COGEN is still runnin' the show?

MANHAS: (Pause) I think he's an elected officialand he gets to determine if he has you know
violated the community standard that he- I mean I do, I- if he doesn't feel that- I mean,

professional and you have a long career in public health and I'm gonna support you

I'm- I- I think it's reasonable that I'm- that they don't- they don't want to support me

I had thought that I was planning to see- like no transition and I feel very irresponsible
about it because I had a lot of work. I had 800 emails sitting in my Inbox and I was
carrying partnerships, you know with, that nobody else was and work. I had like this
strategic plan sketched out that I've- I've killed myself working on in the department for
the last few months and it's in my chicken scrawl but I can't use county equipment or
anything. I can't even get it to anybody.

Right.

Just- anyway.

Okay.

So where did the email come from?

Oh the- well I don't actually even have a copy of it, but I'm. ..
We don't. .. we never seen a copy of it, yes.

Uh the- the email came from employees and um it was basically a threat that if something
didn't happen because of- so this a longer partam, people have
questioned my work but they also question sort of um you know it's just I'm- I'm I
interested in and have raised attention around issues of equity and- and you know race
and you know we are doing dismally in Multnomah County right? The disparage is
getting worse and that's kind of how I've been trying organize the work in-- in funding the
organizations and hiring and stuff and there's been questions of- nothing founded, HR
has been working closely with me, I am so-- you know the concern was around um
something doesn't happen with Sonia or Lillian, Lillian because of her arrest or Sonia
because of her hiring pract- you know her hiring practices, they named five people. It
doesn't even make sense but it's through the five people that I have sense who might-- this
might be and the connection ma- but- 'um, that they were going to out the story, that
we've got- so they to' send- they had this information about the affair but it was about the
personal stuff in the health department that we ca- you know don't understand how

Lillian's still there after her arrest and we know-- you know we'Ve also got concerns about


Were you aware of that?

KMETIC: No, this is all new.

MANHAS: No,

MANHAS:  .the email's important because.
WELLS: So, I would agree, I'd would agree, I'd like to know about it.

MANHAS: . Yeah.

Yeah, and maybe you should tell about the arrest too, just because its- and- I mean that
came before the email right- the arrest?

KMETIC: But we know about the arrest.
WELLS: I'm familiar about Lillian's arrest.
MCKANNA: Oh, okay, alright, alright, okay, alright.

MANHAS: And that it was-- it- a case-- a case of- of an affair with Lillian as well so there's
complicated roles here 

MCKANNA: With her husband (unintelligible)

MANHAS: yeah, so this was an employee that wrote this and um it's rooted in I- I believe, I
mean you could imagine I'm wracking my brain, I'm going insane, right, trying to
unpack like what is going on here? I-- I feel 

KMETIC: In an email that went to who?

MANHAS: It was to be- it sent to the commissioners and Kathleen FULLER POE who's,HR
Director in the Health Department. Okay? And so my understanding, this is just my
understanding is that Deborah KAFOURY sent it to Marissa, his Chief of Staff and that
they talked about it and that- agreed that he would tell me about it, uh, and- and that-

'cause the- Kathleen would have got it and Lillian's would have got it so that they-
they'd- they'd talked and said he would be the point-- he would be the one _to tell me about
it and which he did on Monday afternoon, 

Okay, so what did you learn about it?

He brought a copy of it and I read it. I mean I was so crazy you know 1- I didn't even
think of get- asking for a- can I have the copy? Like I've never seen it since, um, but the
names that were identified were um-- so it was around Sonia's- you know something
needs to be done, Sonia's Lil1ian's prot?ge', like I know you have the perception of
me being so driven and that's so weird. I

Driven's not bad.

Dri-- driven for the health outcome's not for the positional authority.

Oh, no I didn't mean to suggest that, that's. ..

But- but- but this is the interpretation in the department, right? And so I'm reading this
going,' this idea that Sonia's a protege' of Lillian and if she's the department director this
is a big mistake, you know we're worried about her staffing, it- it's baloney, I've got
good people, I've tried to pull in people who would never thing they'd work for
government, like I'm trying to bring innovation to the department, but 

And diversity.

Yeah but diversity and competence and innovation and I've been looking over my
shoulder since the day I started because it's been-- people don't understand that I'm trying
to just get some good work doneemail to threatening to leak the
story to the media, of course by sending it out it's gonna get leaked, if something's not
done to Lillian or I 

So that- we've gotta be talking about the same email. So.

I don't think so, who's the email from?

It- it says, Multnomah County employees. And then a Multnomah County employee, _it
was anonymous.

So do you remember the email addressfake address, it was 

233 Maggie Smith?

KMETIC: No.
MANHAS: No, I mean please look at the email because it- it's- it's about Lillian and I and one of us
needing to go and everything's that followed has been to hurt Jeff, his career, but it's
been- from my perspective? It's been a witch hunt for me.

WELLS: Okay, so we started this by you think you know who did it?

MANHAS: I- yeah- 

WELLS: So you think there's five employees 

MANHAS: Okay so five employees are named in the email as saying- as examples of people hiring.
Alejandro CORREL, David HUDSON, Tamika RAZIL and Nichole HERMANS and
Mya BHAT and Mya BHAT was somebody that was somebody that was let go 2, not 2,
I'm sorry, that was a total mis-statement, not let go, she resigned exactly two weeks
earlier, as I started my vacation. It's just- it- the time- the timing is bizarre and the
connect- I- I-- yeah, those a lot of those people left on their own accord, they have a good
jobs, Alejandro was- is somebody who said- you know he didn't send the email but he-
he- he's a colle- like those were not bad terms or anything but someone's connected these
five people.

WELLS: So are all five of those people, people who have left service with the county?

MANHAS: Um,-uh one is still there, two have other jobs, one was never a person I even supervised.

WELLS: Okay.

MANHAS: But the names connect.

WELLS: So let's break this down so it makes sense. So basically the email to your understanding
is complaining that you and Lillian are out of control and that's why these people are not
there anymore.

MANHAS: Well, I 

WELLS: (unintelligible) down.

MANHAS: I'm out of control, apparently there's some master plan that I'm gonna

MANHAS: Yes, and she- she mentioned many, many that were really terrible and 1- you know I said,

clearly saying to her, this is your complaint and your letter and I'm not gonna tell you
what- what to take out of this. You ultimately need to decide what you want in here and
I'm gonna take forward and she was not happy with the outcome of the inquiry.

anything about what this- what that specific one would have on Tim or I, no I did not. I
said we were fr- I said we're friends and I said I know people are talking about all kinds
of things and she mentioned a few other leaders and ho- and why they were in their
leadership roles, 
WELLS: So 
MANHAS: I I do not remember a del- I do not- I did not 
KMETIC: Were you emotional during the conversation?
MANHAS: Sure, sure, the whole thing was completely upsetting. People were saying-- there are other
rumors about 1- you know I'm hiring people that are not qualified, that I'm you
know biased towards uh people of color, you know don't you think the hiring practices in
the department are biased towards people of color? I'm lookin'- I'm lookin' at the
makeup of the department, Imean there were a lot really racia1ly- they were a lot of
insinuation about me- not about the- the relationship that I was there because I'm a
woman of color and that's what was- that was also- that was upsetting.

MANHAS: That.I'm there because I'm a person. of color?

I'm telling you that I- I-- I- told her that what she wanted to- what she needed to put in

can also say please don't do this 'cause this could be devastating. I

things in here that you're saying other people have said. I mean if you want to include all
those in there you can but I did not call out the one- I didn't call out the one specific thing
and "say this one in particular, take out, I didn't, I said all of those are upsetting and I said

No.

Chair COGEN are having an affair and is there gonna be a secondary document
that is not in it?

No there was an original document that talked about rumors around DLT members, it- it
wasn't that- it wasn't that specific but now I'm worried if I don't have the copy that of
course you know people can- can- can construct things, but I- there was-- there was
suggestion of rumors, absolutely and there was-- that was one of them, but it wasn't called
out in her complaint in that direct way of- that I can recall. I'm mean I'm really trying
here you gu-- to um to recall, I mean I (sighs)

I mean Sonia, here's the deall the- the- the insinuation being, of course,

you know, I mean. ..

MANHAS: No I- I. ..

KMETIC: one of those perception 

MANHAS: I- I totally know and that's why I feel like gotten twisted up in this pretzel'
around this of things that now- because she was bringing forward things of-- of her
concerns around Claire saying things about other people. It wasn?t even her saying I'm
bringing this forward as something to be- to be checked out; I'm just concerned that she's
saying all these kinds of things about people. She's spreading rumors, she's talking about,
you know, unfair practices and-- and-- she's speaking about people's relationship and
that's how it was framed, to me in-in the- in the text and so- but because I'm worried
about the- the- the disgruntled part from even before hand, I just- I feel like I can't-- I'm
not gonna be able to win on this one-- not win, but I'm not gonna be able to heard on it

Well we've talked to peop- we've talked to My-

We've talked to Mya and Mya's. ..

We've talked to Mya.

And Mya's statement is- is Very contrary to- to what we're hearing, so.

Yeah and 1- and I know- I'm- I'm- I know that, the whole. .. A

But like I said we don't have the complaints either so this 

The- the whole- the whole inquiry was so twisted up and the-- the challenge with that
group has been so long standing and I was only starting to understand, like get a feel for
it, I mean literally in the DLT meeting- Department of Leadership Team Meeting, on the
15th, you know Lillian and Kathleen both said to me at that meeting you know, your-

your inheriting like a decade of some really you know dysfunctional dynamic within that
team and-- and something to the extent of it's not- it's- it's no surprise that it's coming out

now with you and I don't know if they were trying to insinuate around race or what- what

that meant but I don't even begin to understand where Mya was going because the-- the
parts on her- her inquiry aro- you know in terms of projecting things that she was
thinking on other people you know it was'- it was really complicated. Some of the things
that she was saying around Claire were things that.she was actually doing and so here I
was trying my best to sort out of walk through the inquiry around these- the-- the-- the-- the
concern around her inquiry had been were- was Claire saying that she was only there due
to ra- like because of race and making allegations around income so I was trying to hold
to- you know to, 

Rightdifferent way?

I just feel like if it came up either way 1- I just don't know what got- what happened here.
Weldifferent way, after you found out about what you perceived to be
either Mya's uh opinion that you were having an affair with COGEN or Claire's opinion

that you were having with COGEN. ..

did you talk about with Jeff? What did you tell him about what you knew?

Well I- I-- I said you know this isn't good. I mean if-- if people had a general perception
that this is happening, I was actually convinced people probably did- you know I'm- I
was- you know I was- I've been worried about it, the whole things been tortur- you know
has been hard. And I, you know I- I said to him that this is concerning, you know, we
were- and this kind of began with the whole thing of like what- what are we- you know
what are we doing? 

Did you- was there any discussion about changing behavior or what you were going to do
as it relates to these employees? Or anything like that?

No, I mean I just said I wanted to walk the inquiry through as best I could in supporting
this person who thought she had a hostile environment. I mean I-- I- with- with truth the
rumors were a piece of that. I figured if you know she was gonna raise it, they were
gonna talk about this with the- part of the investigation, it was gonna happen- it was
gonna happen, right? I truly thought her intent was a hostility that she was dealing with
with this person around concerns around her race and competency and I was trying my
best to really focus on that part in supporting them. Now I- you know I don't- I don't
know what it was now, I mean when I put that together with some of the stuff in the
email I feel like there's some broader thing here around- around me and percep- you
know anger with me and perception of how I hire and such. I don't understand it. I don't--
I don't know how it all ties together. 

So let me skip ahead maybe a little bit, but I mean you probably have to be getting tired,
uh- the- 

1- I think she is getting tired and I'm just- you know I- I think we kind of beat this, I mean
I don't know if she can remember more but, you 

Well this is-- but this is 
I understand.

I- I mean this is-- I mean know we're getting- and we can wrap up and I think we've
already said anyway probably have to come back anyway but what- when we analyze
everything- what has the communication been between you and Jeff since this whole
thing broke? 

The communication has been um shot- I mean shock, more of-- I don't recognize him
(laughs)I'm- just like what are you doing? Like nothing that he is saying has been making
sense to me. .

we can't be in contact obviously but I mean- yeah, I just. 

Oh is that- now I haven't read that completely. You can't be in contact because of the
separation agreement or what?

Oh no no, because this investigation is going on that we just need to speak. I just want to
speak my own part of it so we're not communicating.

So you're not calling, texting, emailing, nothing?
No, no, no, no but- but- but we were-- I mean we were-- we were in shock I mean I-- I was-
I'm sorry I was in shock, you know, he- the way he was presenting things in the I

relationship was not how I understood them to be and I was completely confused, 

Like what parts? I mean 'cause I've watched some of what he said but I haven't watched
all, so 

Well, I mean he's doing what anybody has to do he's trying to salvage his career and to
do that he's salvaging his marriage as well, um, but you know, it wasn't over, we were

still trying to understand what to do and so any-- like any-- I mean it's a cliche I was a

cliche' at that point of like oh my god, you've just like thrown this whole thing under, not
only that you're not even speaking to the- like I don't- who are you? Like it doesn't make
any sense, you know that nothin' none of this affected-- you know it- that- that's what it
was. Like are you gonna resign, like (laughs).

In other words, you think he should.

I mean there's personal opinion about what I think the standard of behavior and the
discredit we brought to the organization but I'm an at-will employee and he's an elected
official and so I don't- I'm- I'm feeling like I did say publicly in the whole turmoil with
the media, I did say yes, I think he that he should and I was in- I mean it was hard to
think. I-- I- I- as a constituent I think he should you know but I'm not him in his elected
official role. I don't know what other inputs he's getting which kind of the whole thing of
this work in general. I mean I don't know all the inputs that he's- he's calculating and I
guess it's up to the- I don't know what the community standard is on when he has to walk
away. People letSam ADAMS stay in and I don't know if that would have been- I don't
know what the answer is to that.

When was your last communication with him?

Umthis week, end of the last week, you know when- when a- when
he sought um legal counsel. It's like oh.

One thing I was going to ask and obviously we're gonna look at computers and so on and
whatnot, I mean, it's always better to hear it from the person rather than to find it
forensically, so is there anything on your work stuff, I know people chuckle, but it
happens right, pictures, nudity, I mean any-- you know what- I know, I know but it
happens so is there anything that we're gonna find that you want to tell us about before
we find it.

Noth- Nothing that I can suggest but I have to tell you with all the emails connected to
the way they were, there's so much more being read into those anyway that I've been
shocked by how people have made connection anyway so you might find things that
surprise you but I'm. ..

No, no, no, but I'm talkin' about things that we know are. ..

She's (unintelligible) saying, have you taken pictures of yourself naked. ..

No.

has he sent you naked 
Is there a sex thing or 



Right.

I know but I mean we got to ask, right? It's always better to hear it from the person like I
said.

Okay.

I'm- I'm just so unresolved about-- I don't know how to explain this piece with Mya. I-

MANHAS: Look this is going to sound completely insane, you know, to say this. But my- my true
heart on this says that I was set up on that. It does, it feels like she threw in a whole
bunch of rumors including that to see howl would deal and that the- the- I- 1- I just don't
think it's what. .. 

KMETIC: But my question is different than that is could she have perceived based on what you
communicated to her that she was being pressured? I mean is-- is that just like I can't even
believe that because that is ridiculous or is it, you know what? I'm thinking about it and
to me I wouldn't have taken it that way, but maybe she did, I mean where is it on that
spectrum?

MANHAS: For- for- for somebody that might have- that might have been the case, for Mya, I don't
believe that to be the case. Like I- I- knowing her-- who she is and rapport we had
together, I don't believe that to- I'm- I'rn hon- I'm telling you the truth, I see what you're
saying and I know how it appears and I acknowledge it. I acknowledge that that could be
perceived exactly that way and I'm mortified. I don't believe that that was the case with
Mya, I really don't. 1- it's. ..

that somebody had said that

it happened.

Yeah, you know there's an in- inevitable- inevitability of it coming out, I mean, the other
part of my meeting with Lillian on that Tuesday was when I sat down with her and says
to me my guidance to you is to tell the truth and it's common knowledge. It's common
knowledge that they all knew. Well if they all knew (laughs) well if they all I knew, I
mean, okay, I- I- I don't know what to say that, so.

I think she was exaggerating a little bit, I mean, I think.

what the emails are gonna tell us as the way you went around uh whoever.

Well, I think the BPA one was imp- I wanted to make sure that we clarified that. 1- I'd-
like this is a long body of work and there's a couple of emails that are in there that

relationship and it was based on our learning from what happened with the water
fluoridation and thinking about some of the- the- the mistakes that were made during that
and- and so that was feedback, not around edging people out but it was around strategy,
about health department Voice Versus elected off1cial's Voice and where that got mucky in
fluoridation and undermine the campaign and so it was- I see how it appears and I see
how that would- that looks now, um, but that wasn't the intent for any personal gain to
me or authority, it was like thinking about strategy on Voice for the policy initiative but
that was one that had concerned me, um. ..

So, and the ones that I'm specif- specifically addressing are there's uh some emails that
seen that discuss a uh Chair COGEN, tell 

yeah, yeah, yeah.

y, z, or next time you see 
Yeah, yeah.

her this and that.

Yeah, that- well the- the office one is good one, an- an example of that with the idea of
you know maybe you should work up here a couple of days.

Moving you to the office, correct.

Yeah, yeah, totally so that that is a good one. Um, you know that- this- this again was
sort of on the end- the- the- the um- the tail of trying to learn about the sport of health and
thinking, but what are the ways we that we can really maximize his work around leading
the Board of Health on some policy initiatives and there was talk around what- what
organizationally does that look like, is it somebody in his office, is somebody um there
and he- you know he suggested to me that I put some ideas together about what it might
look like if you were here a couple of days a week. And I eVen-- you know I had
apprehension about it, this is where the lines were-- he- this is in his role as Chair and I'm
trying to uh, you know staff him and so 1- you know the problem with the meetings are-
the meetings their talking but because I staff them, the email traffic is_- is going the other
way so I'm circling back after the meeting to say, I'm putting it together. He asked me to
do that though, he asked me to put ideas together that he would Vet or he'd want me to
yet with Marissa that- that he would take to Lillian. I know how it looks but I wouldn't--
do it wit- without he- he you know he directed me-- he asked think I understand those email

the idea of putting you in the office and that is his request to move you to his office.

MANHAS: Right and as soon as you know Marissa looked at it, we talked about it, and said this is
going to compromise creditability in terms of being able to staff the entire board, 1- I
agreeded- I agreed and- and that was the end of it, so. ..

WELLS: That was the end of it with- with Marissa?

MANHAS: Thatwas the end of the conversation.

didn't end there, Jeff repeatedly brought it up that he was going to move you uh over
there and Lillian finally sh- according to 

MANHAS: Oh.

for- for what we've said to each other that: that- you're looking for work implication but
what about the personal stuff? I need to understand that. Like will that all- are you
looking at that and you're gonna see what you're gonna report for the investigation, or
are you just gonna have this running record of everything that every media outlet can
look at and see? 'Cause that doesn't seem right.

WELLS: I agree with you. I totally agree. So, I have to say it again, that's kind of one of those it- it
depends but the way that that information is retracted,' extracted from the phone as with
any evidence it's a- it's a copy, it's an exact copy of what is there and that is the record.
I'm not allowed to change it. I'm not allowed to delete it. I'm not- because

KMETIC: I mean here's really how- this investigation- I don't-- first of all I have no idea where this
investigation is gonna go and what's gonna happen but if it goes into a criminal process
as it relates to Jeff, then we have a Discovery obligation where we don't get to pick and
choose what text messages we are going to hand over his defense attorney. They get
everything that we have.

MANHAS: 

KMETIC: Now what they do with that? I mean, that's the difference right- so in that circumstance
he and his attorney are gonna get everything that we have, of course he knows what they

that's one scenario.

um but I cannot deal with that in the media, I just can't. There has to be a way of
protecting that 

Well, that's what-- I- I want to 

Yeah, feel free and talk about it. If you have the phone you can leave it, you guys take
your time, we- we'll step out, but at this point we're kind of there.

We're not gonna do anything with the phone. We'll leave it here.

Can- can I delete my other ones? I can do it right in front of you? And delete my- my- my
other people on there-- there-- 

Your other people? I'm not sure what you mean.

the whole thing is deleted. We have no idea what those are and- and keep in mind that
