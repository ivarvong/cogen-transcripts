Okay so by Chr- December I applied for um kind of an entry level
management position that was a Health Services Specialist and um, my- my
first one was a part time position and um so I applied for a fulltime position
and just- I got it in December or January and so I transitioned in the new year
to a fulltime Health Services Specialist. 1

Okay.

Um, that was working predominately on- you know community partnerships, I
managed our department's Community Health Council, it's an advi-- I don't
know if you want this detail?

Yeah, no it's good. I'm- it's just- you don't have to tell me 
Yeah.
extent what you were doing but just kind of the rolls briefly.

It'll- it kind of lays a story of prevention, building prevention in community
partnerships and addressing issues of health equity and I worked on those
from the Child Abuse Prevention Program to the Health Services Specialist
position and in that position it was a bit of a generalist position, itchance to kind of keep growing it. These started- these are sort of
the seeds that kind of lead to where we are today. Um, that position, okay, let
me think of when I um- some structural changes in the department in terms of
organizational pieces and I was moved into a different unit um called
Community Health Part- CHP3 Community Health Partnerships, I can't
remember the-- Promotions, Partnerships and Planning, it was an awkward
acronym.

Okay.

Um, and then there was a position that became available that was a Chonic
Disease Prevention, it was tobacco prevention. What year would that have
been? I had my daughter in 2004, I'd waited until I was settled in with her, it
was probably about 2005.

Okay.

And I applied forthat uh position andit was the same classification but it was
expanding the work so I applied for it.

Okay.

Um, there was a seri-there was a change in that position because I Wa- I was
building it, it was me and a Point 8 Health Educator. It was very small and this
is where the work really started to take hold. I think this is important to the
story because it-- it was a track record of- I was building capacity for the
department to work on partnerships and prevention and um started to seek
funding, grants and stuff that slowly began to grow the program. During that
time from 2005 to 2009, I'm- I'm gonna have to fumble with these days
just a little bit 

There is a resume of hers among the public documents that I've seen when she
applied 

Yeah.
pretty detailed, so.

The- the- the- the con- the parts that's kind of complicated in the nuance of
the burea- bureaucracy was that I was growing the work and as that was 
happening supervisors apply for reclasses to the position so I was moving and
ex-- you know growing the work and the reclassifications be-- happened and
that's this-- this kind of this movement that I started to kind of develop the
capacity and also my position and scope of work.

Is that managerial at that point?
Yeah.
I mean are you supervising people at that point or is 

Well the first one- the first- when I first I got the Health Services Specialist
position it was one person and I ap- I was able to get some 

Okay.

a local foundation that brought in another person. That began the
department's work in obesity prevention, it was the first position that we got
funded and then I was able to apply for some money through the state that
brought in some tobaccoprevention staff um just trying to build- cobble
together some prevention work for the department. Um, um, so there's some
classification changes that-- that I- I can't remember what they were called in
uh Health Serv- they- they did a reclass in the whole county, they renamed
them, so then it was called the Program Supervisor, was more language that
we could understand, Program Supervisor, then I moved to a Program
Manager and um I say these because it's hard for me to remember the exact

days because there's a- there's a lot of perception around the c1assification's
being really important to me and I can't even necessarily tell you at one point
those happened. I was just so like driven to keep building this work. Um, okay
so it went from Community Health Council to Chronic Disease Prevention
then it was renamed Community Wellness and Prevention. In 2009 I was on
my MAT leave from the Chronic Disease Prevention Program and said I'm on
my MAT leave with my second daughter. I don't want to be bothered because 
I work a lot at home generally but if- I was anticipating further fe- federal
funding coming down the line for prevention that if there was a release of
funding through the Obama>> Administration that that would be legitimate
enough for people to contact me at home. Sure enough, just after Lela was
born, um, there was an announcement and it was a potential boom for
Multnomah County and the community, it was a lot of money. So I worked on
that from home and I mobilized you know 30 partnerships working at home
with my baby taking her to meetings with the commissioners and such. And
um, we got the money, it was 7.5 million dollars. And so um, when I came- I
came back to work Feb- I remember this clearly because I came back to work
February 1" and Lillian met with me at that time and said whether you get this
funding or not the work that you've done to pull this-together is significant
and I want you to lead up what we're calling the Office of um Public Health
Policy in a dual role. That that will be something-- we're building my office
but also manage the Crime Disease Prevention Program, um, and we'll kind of
see what happens. So we started planning in this direction, one week later it
was my birthday, that's why I remember, it was February 8th that we got
notification that we got this- this incredible amount of money in my world
anyway (laughing) massive amount of money. 

Right.

And that just initiated a significant just um what's the word? I mean it was- it
was like a- a train running off the track, it was a 2-year project 

That was 2010? Is that right'? Or do you know?

Yeah, exact- uh, no hold on, yes, yes, yes 'cause we worked on- Lela was
born on 

Okay.

We worked on the grant, I came back to work officially I was working
predom. ..

know predominantly part--time anyway then I came back to work in
February.

Okay.

In February met with Lillian, very first day talking about reforming this office
and um then a week later we get notice of the grant and it was-- and that took
over everything, I mean it was a massive undertaking and it- it- meant di-- you
know working obsessively, um, days, weekends, nights, um to get this- get
this done, get money out to many, many contracts and also higher upin the
department because we didn't have- we didn't really have um- you know we
didn't do this- we didn't have a lot of wor- people doing this work, okay so
that is February and um that was the position that I was in until um the- the
last positionwhich was-- which is this Policy and Planning Director position,
um which was uh last year, last summer of 2012, um, do you want to hear- do
you want me to say how that kind of came to be 

Yeah, sure.


okay so the- so we're in hyperspeed with the grant and um building up
an enti- kind of an entirely different way of working in terms of the
Prevention and Partnerships work and coming one year no-cost extension that got us one more year but then the
conversations becat- became we built up a lot of capacity what's gonna be the
sustainability plan for this? I'm already having two dual roles in the
department. I'm managing Community Wellness and Prevention with the
grant and Tobacco Prevention and a num-- a number of other projects and the
office of Public- of Public Health. What did we call it at that time? The Office
of Public Health Policy and Advocacy, um and- and so then these were the
conversations- this is important work, we can't let this completely fall, we've
supported partners, they're hiring people, you know they're sustaining some
capacity um what are we going to do in the county? And um you know this is
not-- not different from- Lillian has sought my thinking about prevention and
partnerships and equity for many years. Like what's gonna be- you know
what- what- how do we position for the future? What are our learnings and
our practice? Where's Public Health going? And um I've given her ideas
through the years a--around this kind of stuff um, this time she did ask for
some bold thinking that- you know that's what in the emails, some bold
thinking about what-- what are the implications for this- for the Affordable
Care Act and how are we gonna main- maintain some capacity for prevention
moving forward. I mean she's my boss, I have-- I have good ideas and she
asked for them and I gave her some ideas urn you know this is a learning, this

is what I've seen in other jurisdictions, this is what we learned through the
federal initiative, I can see the kind- you know the kind- the kind of things
they're asking us to track. I think we can do better. Um, you know I gave her
that kind of um thinking um, I'd given her this feedback in- in other times too,
changes didn't happen at- at other times but thistime um there was a Director,
Sandy JOHNSON who had left her position managing a- an area called Hea-
uh Health and Social Justice and so um this was- you know they were going to
be posting this position. It was looking at uh- er- it was overseeing Health
Assessment and Evaluation, program design and evaluation and some
prevention work, um, but then ours was outside of that, we sat in another area.
This is confusing I- I realize.

WELLS: Not really.

MANHAS: It's a very complicated (unintelligible) no? Okay. -
KEMETIC: No, no actually I've. ..

WELLS: We're-- we're keeping track.

MANHAS: Okay.

KMETIC: It was way bigger than we expected it was honestly in terms of the Health
Department but no your- it's making sense.

MANHAS: Okay. Um, so she posted the position. I had no idea that it was gonna look the
. way it was. I saw some ideas that were in there that were mine, I'm assuming
other people's too, um, but she posted it, and it was like, oh she's really gonna
do this. She's gonna post this. I'm super excited, you know, I mean that's-
we'd been building for ten years to build some capacityaround Policy 
Prevention. It was amazing um to see you know, taking some program
learning and incor- and you know applying that to the organization for what
public health practice could look like uh, um, so she um, so she posted it and
you know I applied. Um and then there's a whole bunch of stuff about how
that process happened and 1.. . I

WELLS: So if you just walk me through of how you participated in that process.
MANHAS: alright so.
MCKENNA: (Unintelligible) I'm sorry, no I. .. (laughs)

MANHAS: I'm sorry, I uh- I don't how these, I don't how to do these things.

I know we're gonna get there, but just so I can put this in context. When and
we'll get the specifics.

Yeah.
But when did your relationship start with Mr. 
Yeah, um it started in um the summer of 1 1.

Okay and this would have been in terms of you getting this position. That
would have been when?
Uh 12- 2012.

Okay, okay.

So-- and- and I think that's part-- that's part of why I wanted to identify I think
one thing that hasn't emerged is that Lillian formed an Office of Public Policy
and Advocacy that she asked me to lead up that predates all of it. It was
February of um-- of 2010.

Okay.

And um, I actually had forgotten that detail myself until I was sitting in front
of you. .. - I

I'm sorry, I just want to 
Yeah.
. .. piece fit in context before I went ahead.

Yeah, I mean-- yeah, I've played multiple roles and multiple organizational
charts in the department and so it's confusing but 

Okay so we were at the process 

the process- so the process- so she- she- you know the position's posted.
I didn't know it was going to get posted. I didn't know how much was gonna
get incorporated in um and I was excited to see it and I- I- you know I
certainly wanted to apply and I did apply. Um, I tried to stay pretty far away
from the process in terms of who was gonna be on the panel or you know just-
who else had applied because I-- I knew that it was you know best to stay
away. I don't want to get in to any of these conversations with anybody. Um, I
expressed concern to my boss at the time who was Lorene NICHOLS, she's

the Director of Community Health Services. I did express concern to her that I
was worried that it was an internal posting only. That she had just done that
with one of her-- her lead managers and that had created quite a- a problem in
the department around perception and kind of this idea of- of you know okay,
why is it staying clo- like why is staying internal? So Lorene had just gone
through this process with a position where a really great employee um was
applying for it and- and this whole perception thing of like- you know this is
terrible, just open these up, right? Just open them up. I- I knew from this other
staff that she would be highly competitive, so they- they had bad process 
where they had an internal one, they ended up opening it and I was worried
that the same thing was going to play out and I said this to Lorene, and- but I
had no control over the pro- over the process I- I did not have any control at
how Lillian decided to post that, but I had expressed concern that it was going
to be internal, um, I didn't- I didn't know whowas going to be on the panel or
who was going to um who applied, um, and so when I um- well I mean I
applied and I- I was interviewed and it was about 9 people on the panel. It was
a difficult- diff1cultintervi-- it was a diff1cult- the process was difficult, it was
stressful in the organization because people were- were thinking that there
was some intent around this internal process and I was frustrated because I
didn't have control over that, um, but it was very, very stressful for me, um,
for how it was playing out and I remember I-- I wasn't sure if I wanted it
because it was getting really stressful and people were uh- it just- it didn't feel
good- it didn't feel like a good process to me. After the interview process

happened I had I guess- I guess a meeting-interview with Lillian and she at

that time expressed that maybe she'd made the wrong calculation to post the
position how-- how it was and some concerns about it and should she pull it
down and you know what was I thinking about the process. It's like well I
don't really have any control of the process and I- I said to her that we worked

. so hard toe to build the position (gets teary) sorry. I just said that I worked- I

worked really hard to build the capacity and to make the case for the
organizational change that she- that my- if that's where she was thinking that I
suggested to her to reopen it as an open process and that I was really okay
with not being in the job that I just wanted to do the work and that if it meant
for the organization that I shouldn't be the person that~I was fine with that. I- I
swear I said that to her and she said well, let's think about it. I want you to
think it about and send me your ide-- your thinking you know later or talk to
her later on the phone and I have children and I said I can't-- I probably can't
do that until quite late, like you know ten o'clock or something and I just
opted to um write it all like write it to her and I sent her a- a long' email um
just suggesting you know what- what an approach might be to keep it_- you

know to going forward. It wa- it was strange right? Um, and then we met

either the next day or later that week, I can't remember exactly and she said
that she was really impressed with the email response and she wanted to offer
me the job and so I accepted it.

WELLS: And that- if that email you're referring to, that was something you would'Ve
sent to her through her state email account?

MANHAS: Her county email, yeah, yeah.>>

WELLS: I'm sorry, her county email account.

MANHAS: Yeah, I- I'm having a real block on the dates because I think the process was
in August, I was starting- they kind of had me de fact-- I don't know if this was
right- I was starting to do the work although I was not officially in the position
until October but there had been such a gap that people pulled me into the
work right away so it would have been some emails in August.

WELLS: Okay.

MANHAS: I- I think August.

WELLS: So right around the time you got appointed though, like the night before you
got the 

MANHAS: I- I think so, or- or that 

WELLS: That week?

MANHAS: I can't remember like how many days were in--between the- the thinking-

thinking part for her but I-- eh- it had to be relatively tight in time. 

WELLS: Okay. Understanding there were some processes that were done internally,
some processes that had been done 

MANHAS: 

WELLS: comparison to other internal processes that you have experienced and/or
witnessed was this process done similiarly?

MANHAS: I 

Nothing out of the ordinary about this process to your knowledge?

MANHAS: No.

WELLS Alright.

MANHAS: It's- no.

WELLS: So, it kind of brings us to here. We'll come back to some of this stuff I think
in the end as we do this kind of chronologically so let's back up a little bit and
let's kind of weave uh Jeff into this a little bit. So when did you first meet
Jeff? When did 

MANHAS: Oh, first meet him? 0

WELLS: First meet him.

MANHAS: Oh, um, when he was first elected to office, 2004, 2005?

WELLS: Okay.

MANHAS: 2005.

WELLS: Alright. Did not know him before that?

MANHAS: 

WELLS: Okay, do you remember how you guys first met and what that was?

MANHAS: Yeah it was work. I-- I um, I mean he- he was commissioner and I certainly
knew he was there you know and I was working in the Chronic Disease
Prevention Program. I think my first actual interaction with him was when I
did board briefing on kind of a an em- emerging poli- nutrition policy
approaches that they could consider, um, which was chain restaurant menu
labeling and I just did a briefing on kind of what it was.

WELLS: Okay.

MANHAS: And uh he came to me aft- with Lillian, and he came up to me after the thing,
the presentation, the meeting, the board meeting and said that's a really- that's
a really you know interesting idea and if you-- you-- you know if the
department decides it wants to work on that I'd be happy to support and lead
on that and that was my first conversation.

WELLS: Okay, so kind of where'd it uh- where'd it go from there

MANHAS 

Yeah, 
wise as well as how that kind of weaved into work 
Sure.

easier for you to kind of give me context 'cause I can shoot questions at
you all-- all day but it's a little smoother when 

Okay.
of lay it out so.

Yeah, I mean, you know, um, Jeff was a ch- it-- it-- it-- so we worked on the
chain restaurant menu labeling, that became sort of an intensive two years of
my life of trying to pull together a new policy that the board could consider
and he was-- he was really interested in it and he-- he got involved in it and-
and so I started to work directly with his office and- and with him to move
forward. Um, and so almost from that beginning this direct working
relationship and direct communications and direct staffing of him was um
something that came to be. The department was, you know my supervisors

. were fully aware of that and obviously he was-- he was-- you know working

with me to get this stuff- to get it done, um, so that, that- we worked really
closely on the menu labeling piece it was-- it was intense um and we um- he
got- he was interested in prevention- it really lined up with some of the
sustainability issues that he's in- interested in and so we- you know I've- one
of the grants we got from the Northwest Health Foundation was working on a
coalition in North Portland, he was interested in- in supporting that work, he
had some staff come- that were helping us with that, so the work- the work-
the work you know just kind of- we kept- we kept working- we worked on-
on- on- on food policy and prevention while he was a commissioner. Um, let
me see. When we applied for the grant, Ted WHEELER was still in office and
it was the-- it was embargoed and the da-- the morning that we found out the--
the morning that we were able to like announce it publicly was the day that
Chair WHEELER was going to the State as Treasurer I think?

Okay. 

And-- and- and so you know Jeff stepped into some of those roles in- in
working on the grant. He- he-- he was-- he was already- he-- he an- he and the
chair and other folks were int- were integrated into the grant in this big
prevention grant and so the work kind of just kind-- was really intertwined
with the stuff he was doing. I'm not sure how to explain that, I'm sorry. I'm
fumbling with my words because he-- it was-- it was mostly the food policy

work and the prevention work and he- he- he was um interested in hearing
about the stuff.

WELLS: Okay.

MANHAS: So we kept him informed about it. Um, let's see. 

WELLS: At what point- at what point did you guys start to develop more than a
friendship? Can you kind of walk me through- through that. ..

MANHAS: Yeah. . .

WELLS: know the date 

MANHAS: Yeah, um, okay, so you know the date?

WELLS: Well, you--i you gave us the date just a minute ago, I 

KMETIC: Summer of 2000.

WELLS: The summer of 2000.

MANHAS: Oh, okay, yeah, 

WELLS: I mean- if you remember more specific than that's great, 

MANHAS: I actually do, (laughs) I mean it was literarily the first- the first week of
August is-- is when I remember because it- it- I mean, this is intertwined with
personal detail that coincided with the anniversary of my father passing and so
I- I definitely know that that. ..

WELLS: Okay.

MANHAS: how that lined up. Um, so, yeah, um, the personal part of our rela-
you know the relationship and you know this direct staffing and
communication roll was well before we crossed any li-- you know lines and I
think that- that is important- I want to-- I want to make sure people understand
that with the- the- the idea of the chains of communication with the work um
that- that was- that was- that was clearly already happening and people were

MANHAS: Yeah.

WELLS: had- that was on--going well prior to you having a personal relationship.
I am, yeah, absolutely.

WELLS: Okay.

know I want to hear good ideas, I know you've got good ideas and he
encouraged that with me and other 

WELLS Okay.

MANHAS: a direct- a direct link and- and my supervisor was well aware that we
were coordinating policy work directly with him.

WELLS: And at this point when you make reference to my supervisor was aware, is
that Lillian SHIRLEY directly or is that someone else is the supervisor?

MANHAS: It was- it was both, I mean I- I have-- I have a dual- I'd always had a dual role
in the- in the department that when I'd been in positions like the Health
Services Specialist or the Chronic Disease Prevention Program I have a direct
Supervisor like Lorene NICHOLS but Lillian's always on a calendar too, it's
part of the complication is that I've had- I've- I have been in hierarchy but
people have wanted me to directly um also communicate to them or- or- or
staff them even though it doesn't line up on the Org Chart exactly right so
Lillian SHI- SHIRLEY and I have had a direct mentorship and supervisory
role not necessary always on paper but I've always met with her directly and
I've always kept her informed of my work and- and um mostly in community
partnerships and policy work-- that particularly. Um, so Lorene NICHOLS
and- and- and Lillian I'd say.

WELLS: Okay.

we go on. You're doin' great, so the uh, the relationship- that direct
contact with-- with a commissioner and especially the-- the 



Is that somethin' that you think is normal or abnormal in other departments.
Yeah.

other agencies?

Th-- I mean this is-- this is like the key question, right, this is the key question.
Right. A

It's not normal, I was a pioneer for that and I- I say that with positivity
because it was to get really good work done and engage them in- in the
community work in a way that they hadn't been before and it was- it was
really important. I did that with other commissioners too when we were
working on manual labeling. Jeff and I went to other commissioners directly,
nobody in the department had an issue with that. They were encouraging me
to have these direct relationships because our department traditionally has had
a very difficult time being trusted or having relationships with the Board. It
was kind of an us and them dynamic and I found this path of trying to- to- to
work directly with them and involve them in- in work, that wasn't about a
program, it was about community impact. The community putting prevention
to work provided a stage for all of them. When I- when I coordinated a
Healthy School Summit they all wanted to come, they all wanted me to staff
their talking points. I can give you ev- evidence. I wrote Deborah
talking points, I wrote Loretta talking points. I wrote
Jeff talking points. I write Lillian talking points, you
know this was not a secret. This was um- but this is-- is this way of practice is
a part of the dynamic in the department that's been challenging for my
colleagues to understand and I know with this with this prism it- it- it- it
throws all under-- you know it's all confusing now but that from my beginning
of work has been a difficult piece for people to understand me and what I'm
trying to do and the coalition I'm trying to build and if you go back to the
email of how this all ca- was first revealed it's-- it's a really- in my perspective
it's rooted far beyond my relationship with Jeff COGEN, it- it- relates to years
before of people not quite understanding the work that I'm trying to do as
well, but that's-- is what it is.

Just so you know, nobody has questions. I mean I-- I'm not saying you sound
defensive but no- not one person that we'Ve talked has questioned your work
at all.

Yeah, no 

I mean there hasn't be- it's all been very very positive very she gets things
done, she's-- I mean, so for what's it 

I'm, no- I mean I'm a total workaholic, I can't even tell you I mean- ask my
children or you know my- you know ohn- my- my- uh separated husband, I
mean I'm a workaholic. It's taken a tremendous toll on my family
because I've given my life to Multnomah County 

And that's been wr- that's been very clear.

Yeah, that's not 

So can I ask 

Yeah.

there anyone else that you know of 




sure.

you have seen that may have similar type of contact with the
commissioners?

Yeah, yeah, I mean I th-- I think that there are a couple of people that may not
directly report to- to Chair COGEN like um you know Sustainability Staff
you know I think that they also have this kind of a you know more of a
direct- a direct relationship, so folks in the Sustainability Office I think that
um maybe- maybe the Worksite Wellness Manager it- you know we- where
the work is expanding more broadly across the county's interests, I think
people have come in more directly, um, but I think there arepeople in the
health department that have gone directly to speak about their work and I
think that's appropriate that they done that as well, I- I don't know if you want
names but I- it just feels awkward to kind of- but I mean people do that- do
that.

Sure. Do you know of any policies- so I'll use an example. I know in police
departments that I've work they are very much a hierarchy, chain of command
and it's- it's very militaristic, this is how it works.

Yeah.

Is there a policy or a belief system like that within the health department
that's re- strong that you know of or is 

It-- it's- it's. ..
or is just kind of a general guideline?

It's kind of a both-and depending upon who you are and where your program
is in the department I mean and that's the honest truth. You know when I was
in the Child Abuse Prevention Program my experience in the department was
completely opposite, right? I hated it and I was like, oh my gosh, I've made a
big mistake coming to government um it was a difficult place to be I wa-.
'cause I- for where I was lodged deep in the- in the entity. Um, its dif-- I think
it's a 900 person organization and so it depends upon where you are in your
work, even like your hours flexibility is so different if you're in clinic or if
you're- you're um working in partnerships.

Sure.

Um so I- I think that I with manual labeling I you know I think that I was
chartering some new territory. Everybody was fully aware, I was really new in
working on policy I mean it- I was green, I was- you know that was two years
of really trying to understand how to do this work and I was seeking a lot of
guidance from Lillian during that time and so no one indicated it was- you
know that that was not okay um to be doing that. Um, I think it was
encouraged and- and during that time, you know this is technical wonky stuff
that is important to me but we just you know-- I discovered and I- this really
important authority that the board had that they'd never used which is acting
as a Board of Health. They've always acted as a Board of County
Commissioners. I kind of- I-- I- I-- I be- it's im- it's important because I was
trying to understand it and I worked with the attorneys ta- ta- to try to figure
out what that authority meant so that they could adopt manual labeling and-
and it- it led- and it- it was informed by my work with the Community Health
Council 'cause there a governance board and so I was trying to understand the
rule of this governance board for clinical services as opposed to the Board of
County Commissioners and how do these authorities work out so a- my- my
point is they knew that I was sort of deeply trying to understand the roles of

these entities and that I was given-- maybe a li- I was given more stretch
because of that interest of like what is that? What is their role? What can we
do around Public Health policy that we haven't explored before. When they
adopted the policy it was the first time they ever activated that authority and I
was- I was on'a-- a wonky level excited by that and wanted to understand that
more and that- that's where a lot of the work with- with um Jeff also started to
grow, like this is really kind of interesting. What are the things you know
outside of services and programs that we can work on and that- that- that's
also why I think I had- I was working in this different way that others might
not have before if that makes sense.

MANHAS: Yeah so you were wondering

MANHAS: Okay, so you're (laughing) deeply imbedded in the work, he was very

I involved in the grant activities, he served' on the Leadership Team, we became

frien-- and we became friends through this, right? Um, we have music in
common and such and so you know-- the- the- the big piece in the paper uh
we- we um- we went to a concert before anything hap- you know before
anything even happened. We- we were spending time together um as um as
friends, we've had you know lunch or whatever and so um so we- so that, I
don't know that- that's my lead in I guess

something was already under way and we were not. We wen- simply went to
the con-- concert um um and then in August you know we had lunch and um
or- or July 30th right around that-- that week and um you know I don't know
what to tell you (laughs) I mean that's you know he kissed me and um we

WELLS: Okay. Um, obviously he was married at this point, were you married at this
point or separated?

MANHAS: I- I wa-- I- I'm mean I was married but I had already talked to my
husband um you know it's like the moral judgement where- where are we on
the line but I- I mean it is import- it was important to me, it is important to me
that We had already had reached agreement that we could see other people.

WELLS: Okay.

MANHAS: That we were a family, you know we have two daughters and we're- we're

How did this progress from there?

Okay, um, I mean it's not quite as salacious as everybody would want to

it was like lunches, um, and lunches in public places of having food (laughs),
spending time together, you know it was 

How often?

Um, I'd say weekly, absolutely, yeah, I mean, a couple times a week, um of

trying to fit in lunch, maybe coffee you know um, we um, we started walking
on the weekends you know we actually are in the same neighborhood and
we'd spend a couple hours walking. I mean this is all out- like this is all out as
friends would be of-- of- of walking all over north-, northeast Portland and
talking and it was you know from my perspective you know what-- however
it's presented in the media now or- or Jeff speaks to it- for-- for me, it was you 
know deep intellectual emotional intimacy, I mean that's what it became. I'd
gone through lots of trauma you know kind of just even trying to get through
the grant of working so hard and so fast and it was a moment of reflec- like

I thinking and talking and music and books and so it was- it was walks on the

weekend and lunches, um, you know the-- the-- the sex piece was more
sporadic then anyone would- would think to be honest with you, um, but it

lunch with him.

But there's no code that we should like look for, like- mean I know it sounds
silly, but I 



no like- when it says uh you know or it-- I mean there's no code
that we should be looking for? 

No I mean you'll see some that might say Jeff actually with like that- that-
that those were ma- those were you know work things or like meetings with
Jeff and his staff, but um, no, no, I mean because- because the hours for me
were- felt like legitimate personal time I didn't feel like I had to do that kind
of thing though, I. .. 

Alright.
I assume that was telling people you were out of the office.

Yeah, yeah, 'cause I mean people need to able to reach me and I- I- them- you
know the email obsession, yeah, no, but- but you will see them, I- that's why I

Well, I mean often- the-- the-- the-- the truth of it is oftentimes you know he's--
he's way busier-- he's-- his demands are different, I'm- I'm busy, I shouldn't
say he's way busier, 'cause 1- I really am- I have a lot of stuff on my calendar

he there?

MANHAS: Okay, that's easy. Um, Communities Putting Prevention to Work was a big
grant and we'd had: every year there's an annual meeting. We'd and um we're
encouraged- this is kind of what I mean about the new way of pra- of Public
Health practice wasthat we were supposed tobring a team that was
representing the coalitions, you know some of the people that were involved
in the initiative and strongly encouraged to bring elected officials with us as
well because they are part of advancing the- the work and um he was leading
up our leadership team for the initiative and so it was a- kind of a- it was- it
was appropriate that he was helping to lead this-- this piece. We had a couple
of staff and partners um and- and- and so. ..

MANHAS: we went as a team representing Multnomah County. It was an
opportunity for him to meet with other elected officials. He- you know he
spent some time talking to uh you know a guy from Rhode Island on- on some
of the stuff that we're trying to move forward to and I was speaking and I'm-
_I'm the-- I was the principal investigator for the grant so I- I clearly need to go
um and they'd ask me to sp-- to um present ou-- our work so 

KMETIC: When was the first trip? To Atlanta?

MANHAS: Uh, February of- I'm losing track of the years you guys of 12? 2012?
KMETIC: Okay so the relationship has started then, okay.

MANHAS:

MANHAS: Um, you know for the-- for his level of involvement, yeah. I mean truthfully he

was- he was the public voice for the initiative I mean that he was kind of our it
starts here champion and was leading up the team, um, you know we- we had
roles Deborah Ka- you know lots- lots of-- the commissioners
were involved in different ways and Lillian was as well. Lillian's also really
super busy and it's maximizing her roles at the right times um but she knew-
they knew that I invite- you know that I'd invited him to go and they thought

it was

Multnomah County forward on that because I was-- I was trying to help
cultivate his understanding around some of the other ways that other
jurisdictions were- were addressing tobacco and so that was part of- part of

understanding of the issues, um, you know, when we- when we working on
manual labeling, he dug into that, outside of me he was the- the only other
person in the county that had the depth of knowledge on the content, you
know, when we were able to go in front of the editorial board he was- he-
he's- he's really smart and so he could understand the issues and it was in the
interests of the department to have him really uh go and understand and
mostly make the
