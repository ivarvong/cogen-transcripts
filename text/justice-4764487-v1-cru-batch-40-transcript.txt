Um, which would be related to?

Uh, I'm really worried that they're gonna find out I should have paid for
the hotel. I mean anything that involves any of the allegations.

Let me just think for a minute, 

You dummy, you should have paid for the hotel. I mean, you know, I don't
know.

(Unintelligible) I almost did that but I didn't want to do that (laughs). I know,
like really, did you do that? Um- I mean I don't know, depending on when
your-- what-_ there's some on there that are- are going back and forth right um
that you know depending on what you're able to pull from before when the-
you know I-- I'm going to plead naivet? on this that I didn't know what the hell
to doyou know and I-- I didn't know the scale of what this even was and it was
like what-- what are we doing-- like what do you do? And you know basically
the story is he completely like abandoned me anyway so it didn't really
matter, but um, you know at one-- one point I was um texting him to say like
the story's'wrong and I don't understand what's going on and can't we- can't
we figure out a way to- to talk, you know and I- I did say that. It wasn't about
trying to subvert anything but I was just completely confused about what's
happening. Um, and the way that he was portraying the- the relationship as
well.

Did he respond to that?

Um he- he did sort of like, let's-- let me think about it, that kind of thing, 
But you haven't met 

No, no, most of its just acknowledging the devastation and you know'it's just
kind of pathetic because it's devastation, but like I- up until that Monday I
thought we were in a relationship. He's in political mode to save his career but
you gotta understand, it was actually a real thing for me and so I've just been

trying to understand it (teary).

That was- that was going to be my last question iswhat your understanding of
your relationship was, if it was truly a relationship or was it just sex for fun?

(crying).

Okay, 'cause I think that- that really does- in my opinion has a bearing on the
actions. I

I mean 

The actions?

read her letter and it was true, it was 

Okay.

a mistake of falling in love and it was never. . 

So you essentially think that-- well I mean, obviously you wouldn't have
maintained a relationship unless you thought Jeff was in the same place so
this, I mean I don't want to put words in your mouth, so his response has
come as a shock to you?

So you're gonna- yeah you're gonna see chaos down there, 'cause I'm trying

to understand what's going on legally but I actually care for him so you're
going to see me going, are you okay? I'm worried about you going into the

board meeting. And it look- I look like a crazy idiot 'cause clearly he doesn't .

care but that's what you're gonna see.

Is he um, well we'll get at it, I mean is he leading you on at all in terms 
No.

just wait for this to blow over?

No, no, you'll see the last, I mean obviously you know it's- it's- we can't
communicate, this is- you know-- this is- I've got you know the damage. 
mean he's- whatever whatever, right but I'm just tellin' you you're
gonna see that seesaw from me and it's just embarrassing, that's all.

Yeah, I mean I think it's just the- the personal stuff.

Oh I understand. We're not- we're not tryin' to ask you to upset you, I mean.

I know, I know-I know, I know that you're doing job and I respect that" and I
wanted- I wanted to tell someone what really happened 

Well what I can assure is 

You didn't ask about the promotion (laughs).

KMETIC: We-- yeah we did, that was just like a long time ago.

MANHAS: Oh right, okay, right, right, right, right. I

KMETIC: Urn, but what I can assure you about the investigation is it will be probably
longer than you would like, but it will be thorough, it will be complete, it will
be accurate, urn, we're not the media (laughs).

MANHAS: Are- are you looking to charge me?

KMETIC: Uh, I have, well, keep in mind that we haven't looked at any of the

I documents. I can tell you Sonia, that I have um~ I don't know if it's criminal
or not, this- this Mya business givesme pause, because the- the versions are
different. . .

MANHAS 

KMETIC: but um I don't think I have anything beyond a reasonable doubt right A
now as it relates to you but there's-- we're at the- we're at the beginning, so-
the answer is I don't know, I-- I don't know.

MANHAS: Okay 

KMETIC: You know I mean=that's. ..

MANHAS: No, that's-- that's fair.

KMETIC: as best as I can say.

MANHAS: But from what you're looking at right now that's the piece that you're-
you're- you're. .. 

KMETIC: That gives me the most pause.

MANHAS: Yeah, okay.

KMETIC: I mean before I came in I had concerns about the travel piece, I don't have

I those concerns as it relates to you anymore at this point.

MCKANNA: Can you tell me what bothers you about the Mya?

KMETIC: At this point-- of course, and-- and the caveat is we still have to look at

everything.
